    "Tue2": "Hi @! Are you growing yams? I love yams.$h#$b#I also love fish, but I don't think you can grow those.$4",

    "Fri10": "I'm a cat so I can't fix the big stuff, but I can make a shape like a smiley face just for you, @.",
    "Sat10": "Hey, I hope you got good rest. It doesn't have to be a nap, maybe just some time thinking about something nice.#$b#I'm just saying it because I love you and don't want you to be tired.$h",
    "Sun10": "Hey, @... Don't forget to say 'I love you!' to yourself today.#$b#After all, that's the person you want to hear it from the most, right?$h",
