      "Birdie2": "If you're ever feeling queasy in the stomach, a bite of ginger does wonders!",
      "Birdie3": "Have you been to the secret shrine in the jungle? The flowers there smell lovely... It's one of my favorite spots on the island.$h",
      "Birdie4": "Every morning for breakfast, I have a bowl of poi and a glass of freshly squeezed mango juice. It keeps me young!",
      "Birdie5": "I walk the beach every day to see if anything new has washed ashore. There's a lot floating around out there and it shouldn't go to waste!",
      "Birdie6": "My hut may be small, but it's more than enough for what I need. And best of all, I built it myself!",
      "Birdie8": "The Joja cargo ships sometimes pass nearby. They're rich targets for pirates, hehehe...",
      "Birdie12": "Leo's a sweet boy. Confused, but sweet. I keep telling him, a growing boy can't live on walnuts alone!",
      "Birdie15": "Fruit, fish, and foraged food... It's a good diet! I feel as healthy as ever.",
      "Birdie17": "The weather here is warm and lovely year round... perfect for these old bones...",
      "Birdie19": "Have you seen the little banana altar in the jungle? If I had a banana I'd set it there and see what happens... heh heh...$h",
      "Birdie22": "Hello, dear... you look healthy and in good spirits today!$h",
      "Birdie23": "I was born only a few islands over from here, you know. I'd stand at the shore, watching this same big blue sea... That was a long time ago.",
      "Birdie26": "Leo's the closest thing I have to family now. He's half wild, but there's worse things to be!",
      "Birdie28": "It's a full moon tonight... Whether your fortune be good or bad, be on the alert, my dear - the spirits are restless!",
