//Conversation Topics
	//Vanilla
	"cc_Begin": "You're interested in that old building? Hmmmm, I wonder why?$6",
	"cc_Boulder": "I heard strange noises near the mines last night, and now that boulder's gone.#$b#I hope no monsters take advantage of that.$4",
	"cc_Bridge": "The quarry's mostly depleted thanks to Joja's prior activity, but you might still find it useful, @.#$b#Just be careful around that cave near there. It has a terrible smell.$4",
	"cc_Bus": "I recognize that the bus being up and running is an improvement, especially for Pam, but I don't really like the noise it makes.$s",
	"cc_Greenhouse": "That's a lovely new structure you have on your farm. And it's free of rats now, so feel free to plant away.$6",
	"cc_Minecart": "Jorts, they're called a MINE cart for a reason.$4",
	"cc_Complete": "Very impressive, @. You and your many 'friends' should be proud.$6",
	"movieTheater": "Well, time to go see if our new theater employees are interested in a collective.",
	"willyCrabs": "Jorts and I went to help Willy with his crab problem. Feisty, but they're tastier that way.$h",
	"pamHouseUpgrade": "@, that was very generous of you. You understand what it means to be in a community. When one is better, we're all better.$h",
	"pamHouseUpgradeAnonymous": "The person who funded Pam's house, who surely must be a mystery, @, is quite the generous person.$6",
	//ARV
	"SterlingTrash": "Well, it's good that Sterling didn't make a mess all over the place, but...$3#$b#Jorts and I use those trash cans sometimes, you know.",
	"SterlingTrain": "Jorts, no. We do not play with trains.",
	"SterlingDrugs": "Sterling....#$b#I think he might be making a mistake. But I don't think he'll listen if I say that. Sometimes we just have to make mistakes to learn.$6",
	"SterlingRelapse": "I'm not sure if Sterling is up for hugs at the moment, so I'll just sit near him and purr and let him make the first move. No pressure that way.",
	"SterlingApology": "It's good that Sterling and Pierre made up. Pierre's a good influence on Sterling, but Sterling is also good for Pierre.$h",
	//Alecto
	"AlectoIntroduction": "Alecto's companion Titania and I get along quite well. We have some things in common, despite her being a bird.#$b#No, I don't pounce on her. It's unprofessional to bother a fellow working animal.",
	"AlectoWizardTower": "I need to go find Titania and talk with her sometime soon. She's never going to believe what Jorts did now.$h",
	//JulietJessie
	"JulietGremlin": "JORTS that is a DOG it is NOT a friend.$4",
	//Juna
	"JunaBeachBallet": "Juna's ballet form is lovely, but there's something rather melancholy to her dance. Perhaps that's why she prefers dancing in the rain?",
	"JunaJunimos": "I found a gold statue of Lewis while scouting the woods with Jorts.#$b#The Mayor and I are going to have a... TALK about this.$a",
	"JunaGone": "Juna left on the bus this morning. She had a determined look in her eyes.#$b#I hope whatever it is she's trying to accomplish, she's successful.$h",
	//Lavril
	"LavrilUnlocked": "There's something off about those two... I can't place my finger on it, but they're no ordinary child and talking rabbit doll. Makes my fur tingle.$4",
	//Lucikiel
	"LucikielArrives": "That demon seems very, very dangerous. Be careful, @.$4#$b#On the other hand, he did turn a manager into a pig, so maybe he's not all bad. I wonder how he feels about worker's rights?",
	"ReputationIncreased": "Clint's been advocating for Lucikiel for a while. It's good to see people noticing.#$b#I think the relationship has been good for both of them.$h",
	//Jasper
	"JasperGone2": "Marlon and Jorts and I are going to look around the mines later if Jasper doesn't return swiftly.$s#$b#I'm not fond of the mines, but a person's safety is more important.",
	"JasperHomeA": "Jasper might be injured and in pain right now, but I hope he remembers that he's still alive and that matters.",
	"JasperHurt": "I know Jasper seems in high spirits, but I think he's putting on a brave face. He can't hide the look in his eyes when he checks the shadows.$s",
	"Jasper_Bionic": "Maru's design is quite clever. Perhaps she should consider further work in medical engineering.$h",
	//RSV
	"RSV_GH1": "Jorts and I will go up to see the new greenhouse sometime soon. I'm sure there will be some stubborn rodents that need evicting.$6",
	"keahi_prank": "Ah... I see you've met Keahi, @.$s#$b#He has quite the reputation even in Pelican Town.$6",
	"Lidens_Return": "I'd heard from Lenny that Alissa's parents have been gone a long time. It must have been important to keep them away.",
	"Naomi_Return": "It's good that Naomi was able to return to Ridgeside. Those boys can't raise themselves, they need a parent present for the adult things.",
	//Leilani
	"LeilaniArrives": "I'm sure it's difficult for Leilani to be away from her family, but I'm also proud of her for not neglecting herself and her own pursuits.",
	//Prank the Jojamart
	"PTJ03": "A poetically appropriate mishap for a 'crabby' miser like Morris.$h",
	//Pumpkin Spice
	"pumpkin_spice_madness": "Pumpkin spice smells lovely, but please don't give Jorts any. It's really not good for us cats.",
	//Toshinori
	"TalkingAboutToshinori": "Toshinori is a very kindhearted person who's lived in service of others.#$b#The downside to that is that such people often have a hard time being kind to themselves...$6",
	"ToshisSon": "I can see why Izuki and Toshinori are so close. They have similar personalities.",
	//Jorts and Jean (lol)
	"MeetTheCats": "Some of the townsfolk are quite comfortable with conversing. Others don't listen very well.#$b#And others who are certainly not named Lewis are just in denial.$h",
	"ButteredJorts": "Please don't develop a drinking habit, @. As you might have heard, it leads to foolish decisions.$s",
	"DumpsterFishing": "There's nothing wrong with using things others have discarded. I just wish they were a little more accessible for Jorts.",
	"RubberCatting": "@, make sure you take care of your mind as well as your body. Mental health is important, too.",

	

	// GENERIC DIALOGUE
    "Mon": "Good day, @. Do let us know if you have any pest problems on the farm. I do enjoy a good mouse lunch.$6", 
    "Tue": "Greetings, @. I hope you're integrating well into this community.",
    "Wed": "Hello, @. We're usually somewhere around the town if you need us. We try to visit as many as we can.",
    "Thu": "Don't forget to ask for help if you need it, @. You are never so strong that you don't need help.",
    "Fri": "Hello, @. If you have need of our help, let us know.#$b#Though keep in mind that we are cats, and lack things like opposable thumbs.$h",
    "Sat": "*yawn* Hello, @. Could you let Jorts know if it's a problem?",
    "Sun": "@, are you feeling you have the hang of agriculture yet? If not, why not talk with some of your fellow gardeners and growers? I'm sure you could learn something.",

    "Mon2": "One thing to remember, @: this isn't a big city like Zuzu. We are all dependent on each other.#$b#Big city tactics--like Joja's approach--will not work here.", 
    "Tue2": "Morris is a greedy scumbag, but he's also a very typical greedy scumbag, unfortunately. There's thousands like him in the city.",
    "Wed2": "I hope you're not having a problem sourcing things you need out here. Try to shop local if you can.",
    "Thu2": "It's good to get out and enjoy nature sometimes, isn't it?$h",
    "Fri2": "Yes, you may pet me, but only when I consent to it.$6",
    "Sat2": "Whether or not you have children, I think it's every adult's duty to make the world better than when you were a child, for the sake of future children.",
    "Sun2": "Best to let Jorts rest today. He had a long night dashing around the Guildhall.",

    "Mon4": "Morris had the nerve to try and throw water on me! Talking about unions is a federally protected activity, you know!$a", 
    "Tue4": "I asked Gunther if I could have a book deal. I knocked books off the shelf and he had to deal with it.$6",
    "Wed4": "Jorts isn't smart?#$b#Well, I suppose if you expected a fish to climb a tree, you'd think it wasn't smart, either.",
    "Thu4": "We were once city cats, but I find it's easier to be heard in a smaller place like this.",
    "Fri4": "It's funny how even in a small town where a Monday to Friday schedule isn't the norm, everyone looks forward to Friday evenings.$h",
    "Sat4": "I have made my scratching preferences clear to Marlon. If he chooses not to accomodate them, the bear rug is right there.$6",
    "Sun4": "I don't mind cleaning Jorts, even when he gets into trash. I like caring for others.#$b#Though I suppose that's no great surprise, given that it is my job.$h",

    "Mon6": "People are all deserving of proper pay and safe working conditions! And if someone doesn't get that, I'll claw their legs.$a",
    "Tue6": "I hope you won't try and put a collar on me, or Yoba forbid, a *hat*. Please respect my autonomy.",
    "Wed6": "Some people act like they hit a home run when they were born on third base.$a",
    "Thu6": "Things might seem unreasonably unfair, @. But once you can name an unfairness, you can take steps to address it.",
    "Fri6": "%Jean is talking to herself.#$b#Okay, Jean, it's a lot of noise but you can always hide under the counter and let Jorts take over.",
    "Sat6": "I normally don't mind cleaning Jorts, but slime is, uh... let's just say it's not good for cats.",
    "Sun6": "Jorts always knows when I need to take a break. He can handle any human, no matter how loud they are.#$b#He cleans up nicely, too.$h",


    "Mon8": "I suppose I *could* just drink water from the river, but it's tastier when I dip my paw into your glass and lick that instead.$6",
    "Tue8": "If someone doesn't like cats, can you really trust them? Truly?$6",
    "Wed8": "@, if you're struggling, try and imagine I'm sitting next to you and purring. I don't have a loud purr, but you can feel it.",
    "Thu8": "The way Jorts walks ahead of me with his tail in the air, completely confident... it's quite adorable.$h",
    "Fri8": "Do you feel like you're part of the community now, @? Remember there are people here that support you like you support them.",
    "Sat8": "I don't care if they are scary, the next monster I find investigating my litterbox is going to get it.$a",
    "Sun8": "@, you look like you've had a rough day. If you'd like, sit down and I'll clean you up a little.",

    "Mon10": "Sometimes, deciding *not* to do something is braver than doing it.",
    "Tue10": "Make sure you're taking time to rest, @. You don't have to be productive all the time.#$b#If it was something you enjoyed, it's not wasted time.$h",
    "Wed10": "@, when people compliment you, I hope you take it to heart and don't downplay it.#$b#It might be embarrassing but I bet it still feels better than brushing it off and insulting yourself.$h",
    "Thu10": "You know, no one 'invented' the car by themselves. It was a bunch of little inventions from all sorts of people that make the cars you know now.#$b#Your accomplishments are built on the work and knowledge of others. But so are the ones of the supposed 'geniuses' out there.",
    "Fri10": "I'm giving lots of advice lately? Well, I suppose that's true.#$b#I care about you, so I want to make sure you hear the thing you need to hear.",
    "Sat10": "Here, @. I had a good fishing day and I'd like to share. [149 151 698 704 707 715]",
    "Sun10": "Occasionally I'm afraid to ask a question because I don't want to look silly, but then Jorts asks it for me.#$b#It's good to ask 'silly' questions in case others need to hear the answer, too.$h",   
   
   "rain":  "{{Random: I don't like rain. It's wet and cold and gets everywhere.$s && Ugh, I HATE thunder....$s && Today seems like a good day to stay inside and clean oneself. Without water.$6 && We're taking the day off today. We don't dry as easily as humans do. && I might get in the water while fishing, yes, but that's completely different from RAIN.$s |inputSeparator=&&}}",	

	// SPECIFIC DAY DIALOGUE
	"spring_1": "I hope you were able to get some rest during winter, @. Now the cycle begins again.",
	"summer_1": "Stardew is not only hot during the summer, but the ocean and lakes make it quite humid. It's even more important to stay cool and hydrated, @.",
	"fall_1": "Do you think summer or fall is busier for you, @? Lots of crops need the warmer weather, but it's *too* warm for some.",
	"winter_1": "Are you staying warm, @? Humans don't have enough fur for this sort of weather.",
	"spring_12": "Even if you're not fond of chicken eggs, there should be something you'll like at the festival tomorrow. Gus is pretty thoughtful about vegetarian options.", // Day before the Egg Festival
	"spring_23": "There isn't really much for cats at the Flower Dance, but that's okay. Not everything has to cater to a specific person.", // Day before the Flower Dance
	"summer_10": "Honestly, there's no way the soup should come together well, but yet it always does.#$b#As long as you bring something high quality, I'm sure it will be fine.", // Day before the Luau
	"summer_27": "I hope you'll go out to see the jellies tomorrow, @.#$b#Even if you're surrounded by it, it's good to be reminded how majestic nature can be.$h", // Day before the Midnight Jellies
	"fall_9": "Did you know it's my birthday today? I don't need any gifts other than your support for workers.#$b#Though a ball of string will also be accepted with gratitude.$h",
	"fall_15": "Why does Jorts want to knock everything off the display tables? A simple zest for life, I'd say.$6", // Day before the Stardew Fair
	"fall_26": "Spirit's Eve is a festival that is designed to placate restless, angry spirits.#$b#And believe me, they DO need placated.$4", // Day before Spirit's Eve
	"winter_7": "I'll need to figure out the best time to grab a few fish from the competition. It's a waste to put them all back, if you ask me.", // Day before the Ice Festival
	"winter_24": "Don't stress too much about the gift exchange, @. The best presents are the ones that have thought put into them.$h", // Day before Winter Star
